Workplace Bias: Hair Discrimination/Racial Micro-aggressions
README.md

This project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create an interactive scrollytelling visualization. The visualization combines a pie chart and a poem to convey a narrative about hair discrimination. Users can navigate through keyframes to reveal different aspects of the story.

Files:

final_main.js: JavaScript file containing the main logic for the scrollytelling visualization. It includes functions for drawing the pie chart, handling keyframes, and updating the active elements in the poem.

final_style.css: CSS file defining the styles for the HTML elements in the visualization, including the layout of columns, colors, and typography.

index.html: HTML file that structures the web page, includes necessary libraries, and sets up the layout for the scrollytelling visualization. It references the JavaScript and CSS files.

Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


- Scroll down the page to progress through the keyframes and reveal different parts of the poem.
- Use the forward and backward buttons in the footer to navigate between keyframes manually.

Customization:

You have the option to customize the content, styles, and interactivity based on your specific requirements. Explore the JavaScript file (final_main.js) to understand the logic and modify it as needed.
